This project is currently under development.  
It is designed to transcribe audio and video files using Whisper (local models) and optionally summarize the content with large language models such as OpenAI GPT.  

The application will support both local processing (using GPU or CPU) and remote processing via API keys.  
Users will be able to configure models, output formats, and processing options through a graphical interface.
